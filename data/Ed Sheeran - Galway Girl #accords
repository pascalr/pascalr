[Intro Chorus]
    Em                     G
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
        D                   Cadd9
But she fell in love with an English man
Cadd9                      G
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance
[Verse 1]
             Em             G
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
             D                       C
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
             Em                    G
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
            D                                                C
Said it was one of my friend’s songs do you want to drink on?
         Em                G
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
        D                    C
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding a shotgun
Am7                G
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
D
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
[Chorus 1]
    C                   G
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
        D                C
But she fell in love with an English man
C                          G
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance
                      Cadd9  G     D     Em
With my pretty little Galway Girl
                        Cadd9  G     D     Em
You’re my pretty little Galway Girl
[Verse 2]
             Em                   G
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
             D                          C
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
        Em                 G
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
      D                                     G
After dancing to Ceili singing to trad tunes
        Em                     G
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
     D                    C
A cappella in the bar using her feet for the beat
            Am7                    G
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
            D
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
[Chorus 2]
    C                   G
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
        D                C
But she fell in love with an English man
C                          G
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance
                      Cadd9  G
With my pretty little Galway Girl
D                Em         Cadd9  G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D                Em         Cadd9  G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D                Em         Cadd9  G    D  Em
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
[Verse 3]
          Em                   G
Now we’ve outstayed our welcome and it’s closing time
      D                          C
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
    Em                 G
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
      D
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
  Em              G
I walked her home then she took me inside
       D                 C
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
  Em                         G
I swear I’m going to put you in a song that I write
        D
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
[Chorus 3]
    C                   G
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
        D                C
But she fell in love with an English man
C                          G
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance
                      Cadd9  G
With my pretty little Galway Girl
D                Em         Cadd9  G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D                Em         Cadd9  G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D                Em         Cadd9  G    D  Em
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
