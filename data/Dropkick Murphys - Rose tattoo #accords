[Verse 1]
Am
The pictures tell the story
     C
This life has many shades
G                              Am
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
    Am
I’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
     C
That smoldered in it’s tray
G                            Dm                Am
Down a little something and then be on my way
Am
I traveled far and wide
    C
And laid this head in many ports
      G
I was guided by a compass
      Am
I saw beauty to the north
Am
I drew the tales of many lives
              C
And wore the faces of my own
               G
I had these memories all around me
     Dm
So I wouldn’t be alone
[Pre-chorus]
C
Some may be from showing up
G
Others are from growing up
Dm                               Am
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
        C
I ain’t winning no one over
  G
I wear it just for you
Dm
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo
[Chorus]
Am
In a rose tattoo
     C
In a rose tattoo
              Dm
I’ve got your name written here
           G  Am  
In a rose tattoo
[Interlude] Comme intro                      
[Verse 2]
Am
This ones for the mighty sea
C
Mischief, gold and piracy
G
This ones for the man that raised me
Am
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
Am
This ones for our favorite game
C
Black and gold, we wave the flag
G
This ones for my family name
      Dm
With pride I wear it to the grave
[Pre-chorus]
C
Some may be from showing up
G
Others are from growing up
Dm                               Am
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
        C
I ain't winning no one over
  G
I wear it just for you
              Dm
I’ve got your name written here
In a rose tattoo

[Verse 3]
F
This one means the most to me
C
Stays here for eternity
  G
A ship that always stays the course
   Am
An anchor for my every choice
  F
A rose that shines down from above
  C
I signed and sealed these words in blood
  G
I heard them once, sung in a song
   G
It played again and we sang along
[Interlude]
Am  C  G  Am  x2

Am
You’ll always be there with me
C
Even if you’re gone
       G
You’ll always have my love
    Dm
Our memory will live on
C
Some may be from showing up
G
Others are from growing up
Dm                               Am
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
        C
I ain't winning no one over
  G
I wear it just for you
              Dm
I’ve got your name written here
     N.C.
In a rose tattoo
