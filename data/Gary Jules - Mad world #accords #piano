[Intro]
Em A
Em A

[Verse 1]
Em                     G
   All around me are familiar faces
D                A
Worn out places, worn out faces
Em                            G
   Bright and early for their daily races
D              A
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Em                         G
   Their tears are filling up their glasses
D              A
No expression, no expression
Em                         G
   Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
D            A
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

[Chorus]
Em                     A                      Em
   And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
                        A                            Em
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
                  A                           Em
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
                   A
When people run in circles, it's a very, very
Em     A
   Mad world
Em     A
   Mad world

[Verse 2]
Em                          G
   Children waiting for the day they feel good
D               A
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Em                           G
   Made to feel the way that every child should
D               A
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Em                           G
   Went to school, and I was very nervous
D               A
No one knew me, no one knew me
Em                         G
   Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
D                      A
Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus]
Em                     A                      Em
   And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
                        A                            Em
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
                  A                           Em
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
                   A
When people run in circles, it's a very, very
Em     A
   Mad world
Em     A
   Mad world
Em              A
   Enlarge your world
Em     A
   Mad world
