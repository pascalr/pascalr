[Intro]
F

[Verse 1]
F
We can dance if we want to
       A#                   Dm
We can leave your friends behind
                                     A#
'Cause your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance
           C                   F
Well, they're no friends of mine

[Verse 2]
F
We can go where we want to
  A#                          Dm
A place where they'll never find
                                A#
We can act like we've come from out of this world
          C              F
leave the real one far behind
[Bridge 1]
A#                  Dm     C
We can dance, We can dance
A#                  Dm     C
We can dance, We can dance

[Verse 3]
F
We can go where we want to
             A#                Dm
The night is young and so am I
                                 A#          
We can dress real neat, from our hands to our feet
       C                         F
And surprise them with a victory cry

[Verse 4]
F
We can act if we want to
       A#              Dm
If we don't nobody will
                          A# 
You can act real rude and totally removed
           C              F
and I can act like an imbecile

[Chorus 1]
A# 
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                      C
Everything is out of control
A#
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                    C
Doing it from wall to wall
A#
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                     C
Everybody look at your hands
A#
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                           C
Everybody's taking, taking the chance

[Verse 5]
F
We can dance if we want to
          A#                     Dm
We've got all your life and mine
                             A#
As long as we abuse it we're never gonna lose it
     C                   F
Everything will work out right

[Verse 6]
F
We can dance if we want to
       A#                       Dm
We can leave your friends behind
                                     A#
'Cause your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance
          C                 F
Well, they're no friends of mine

[Chorus 2]
A#
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                   C
Everything is out of control
A#
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                   C
Doing it from wall to wall
A#
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                   C
Everybody look at your hands
A#
We can dance
F
We can dance
Dm                           C
Everybody's taking, taking the chance
