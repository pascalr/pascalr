F C F
[Verse 1]
F   A             Dm         Bb
   You and me we made a vow
F       A             Dm     Bb
   For better or for worse
F     A                 Dm          Bb
   I can't believe you let me down
          F              C      F
But the proof is in the way it hurts
F       A                  Dm      Bb
   For months on end I've had my doubts
F     A           Dm       Bb
   Denying every tear
F     A                Dm         Bb
   I wish this would be over now
           F                C        F
But I know   that I still need you here
[Chorus]
    F A       Dm   Bb
You say I'm crazy
       F                  A               Dm    Bb
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     F A      Dm  C   Bb
But when you call me baby
    F               Bb   F    Bb
I know I'm not the only one
[Verse 2]
F          A          Dm       Bb
   You've been so unavailable
F       A           Dm         Bb
   Now sadly I know why
F        A             Dm      Bb
   Your heart is unobtainable
        F          C             F
Even though Lord knows you have mine
[Chorus]
    F A       Dm   Bb
You say I'm crazy
       F                  A               Dm    Bb
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     F A      Dm  C   Bb
But when you call me baby
    F               Bb   F    Bb
I know I'm not the only one
[Bridge]
Bb                        F
   I have loved you for many years
 A                     Dm  C
Maybe I am just not enough
Bb                            F
   You've made me realise my deepest fear
    Bb/C                   
By lying and tearing us up
[Chorus]
    F A       Dm   Bb
You say I'm crazy
       F                  A               Dm    Bb
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     F A      Dm  C   Bb
But when you call me baby
    F              Bb    F
I know I'm not the only one
    F A       Dm   Bb
You say I'm crazy
       F                  A               Dm    Bb
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     F A      Dm  C   Bb
But when you call me baby
    F              Bb    F
I know I'm not the only one
[Outro]
    F              A      Dm    Bb
I know I'm not the   only one
    F              A    Dm    Bb
I know I'm not the only one
        F                    A      
And I know and I know and I know and I know
Dm          C        Bb
And I know and I know know
    F              Bb    F
I know I'm not the only one</pre>
