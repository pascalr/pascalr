The boundaries between concepts of shame, guilt, and embarrassment are not easily delineated.[9] According to cultural anthropologist Ruth Benedict, shame is a violation of cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one's internal values.

Since his early work on the effects of secret keeping, Pennebaker has focusedmuch of his research on the healing power of expressive writing. In his bookWriting to Heal, Pennebaker writes, “Since the mid-1980s an increasing numberof studies have focused on the value of expressive writing as a way to bringabout healing. The evidence is mounting that the act of writing about traumaticexperience for as little as fifteen or twenty minutes a day for three or four dayscan  produce  measurable  changes  in  physical  and  mental  health.  Emotionalwriting  can  also  affect  people’s  sleep  habits,  work  efficiency,  and  how  theyconnect with others.”

Je me sens honteux de:
Ne pas avoir assez d'amis.
Ne pas avoir fréquenté assez de filles.
N'avoir rien à faire de la fin de semaine.
N'avoir rien à faire de la journée.
D'être seul.
Ne rien faire à ma fête.
</p>

Je dois m'occuper au moins 4h par jour, parce que si je mets tout le focus dessus c'est trop de pression et ça ne marche pas.
Comme Richard Feynman l'a dit. Il doit enseigner sinon c'est trop de pression sur seulement la recherche.
Alors faire sois: Musique, Programmation ou Updgrade mon appart. Décider la veille et m'en tenir.

Je décide aujourd'hui c'est la musique. En faire jusqu'à 18h.

<h1>Hope</h1>

Hope is a good thing. Maybe the be of things - Shawshank Redemption

Is hopelesness is the opposition of hapiness, this means hope is hapiness.

You have to push-pull a girl so that she hopes she can be with you.

I think my happiness is a roller coaster because my hope is short term. I hope i will talk to a get tonight.
If I don't I feel really bad, not because I failed but because it destroys my hope.

I am always doing that.
