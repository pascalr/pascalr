[Verse 1]
D#
My life is brilliant.
D#/D
My love is pure.
Cm7
I saw an angel.
G#add9
Of that I'm sure.
    D#
She smiled at me on the subway.
        D#/D
She was with another man.
    Cm7
But I won't lose no sleep on that,
       G#add9     A#/D
'Cause I've got a plan.
[Chorus]
G#add9       A#/D Cm7          A#/D
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
G#add9       A#/D      D#
You're beautiful, it's true.
  G#add9   A#/D      D#  A#/D Cm7
I saw your face in a crowded  place,
      G#add9     A#/D    Cm7
And I don't know what to do.
            G#add9 A#/D    D#    D#/D    Cm7     G#add9
'Cause I'll never be with you.

[Verse 2]
          D#
Yeah, she caught my eye, 
      D#/D
As we walked on by.
          Cm7
She could see from my face that I was, 
G#add9
  Fucking high, 
    D#                      D#/D
And I don't think that I'll see her again, 
    Cm7                          G#add9
But we shared a moment that will last till the end. 
[Chorus]
G#add9       A#/D Cm7          A#/D
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
G#add9       A#/D      D#
You're beautiful, it's true.
  G#add9   A#/D      D#  A#/D Cm7
I saw your face in a crowded  place,
      G#add9     A#/D    Cm7
And I don't know what to do.
            G#add9 A#/D    D#
'Cause I'll never be with you.
G#add9       Cm7          G#add9         A#/D  G#add9 A#/D
  La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la
[Outro]
G#add9       A#/D Cm7          A#/D
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
G#add9       A#/D      D#
You're beautiful, it's true.
      G#add9     A#/D         D#       A#/D Cm7
There must be an angel with a smile on her  face,
         G#add9                   A#/D          D# A#/D Cm7
When she thought up that I should be with you.
         G#add9  A#/D     Cm7
But it's time to face the truth,
       G#add9 A#/D     D#
I will never be with you.
