          D                  G         C      G/B
This thing,  called love, I just can't handle it,
          D                  G        C        G/B
This thing,  called love, I must, get round to it,

This thing, called love, it cries, in a cradle all night,
     D                  G                      C     G/B
It swings, it jives, it shakes all over like a jellyfish,
        D        Bb           C             D      N.C.
I kinda like it, Crazy little thing called love.

There goes my baby, she knows how to rock and roll,
              Bb                  E7           A7
She drives me crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever,

then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat.
