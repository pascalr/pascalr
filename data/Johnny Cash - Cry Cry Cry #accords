 Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down,
                                    F#7      B7
 I think you only live to see the lights up town,
  E
 I wasted my time when I would try try try,
      A                                        B7      E
 cos when the lights have lost their glow you cry cry cry

 Soon your sugar daddy's will all be gone,
                                  F#7         B7
 you'll wake up some cold day and find your alone,
         E
 you'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you bye bye bye,
         A                                B7      E
 when I turn around and walk away you'll cry cry cry,
[Chorus]
 E         
 Your gonna cry cry cry,
 and you'll cry alone 
       A                           E
 when everyones forgotten an your left on your own 
              B7          E

 I lie awake at night an wait till you come in,
                                       F#7    B7
 you stay a little while and then your gone again
          E
 every question that I ask I get a lie lie lie
       A                            B7      E
 for every lie you tell your gonna cry cry cry
[Verse]

 When your fickle love gets old no one will care for you
                                           F#7        B7
 Then you'll come back to me for a little love thats true
       E
 I'll tell you no an then you'll ask me why why why
      A
 when I remind you of all this 
             B7      E
 your gonna cry cry cry
[Chorus]
 E
 Your gonna cry cry cry and you'll want me then
          A                          E
 it will hurt when you think of the fool you've been
             B7      E
 your gonna cry cry cry
