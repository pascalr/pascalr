F#m D E C#m
[Verse 1]
         F#m
They say oh my god I see the way you
 D
shine
          E
Take your hand, my dear, and place them
           C#m
both in mine
              F#m
You know you stopped me dead when I was
           D
passing by
           E
And now I beg to see you dance just one
        C#m
more time
[Pre-Chorus]
     F#m                              D
Oh I see you, see you, see you every time
          E                    C#m
And oh my I, I, I, I like your style
         F#m
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna
     D
try
           E
And now I beg to see you dance just one
        N.C.
more time

F#m
Dance for me

I've never seen anybody do the things you
          C#m

They say
F#m
Move for me
Move for me
                   D
Move for me, ay ay ay

And when you're done I'll make you do it
         C#m

       F#m                         D
I said oh my god I see you walking by
         E
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my
     C#m
 eyes
             F#m
Just like a monkey I've been dancing my
         D
whole life
              E
And you just beg to see me dance just one
          C#m
 more time
[Pre-Chorus]
     F#m                             D
Oh I see you, see you, see you every time
          E                     C#m
And oh my I, I, I, I like your style

You, you make me, make me, make me wanna

           E
And now I beg to see you dance just one
         N.C.
