 Am
(oh, baby) i don't wanna lie,
          Dm7
I'm gonna take what you're giving
       E
'cause i know you're willing,
   Am                              Dm7
To take me all the way..you got me right here.
 Am             Dm7                         E
Combustible. and i can't wait to finally explode.

[Chorus]
            Dm7                   Am
The big big bang, the reason i'm alive,
                   E                          Am
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside.
             Dm7    Am    E    Am
The big big bang (3x)

[Verse]
                              Dm7
Some people like to talk. but i'm into doing,
     E                       Am
What i feel like doing, when i'm inspired.
                 Dm7            Am
So, if we take a walk down, the beach tonight,
  E
I bet we could light up the sky.

[Chorus]
            Dm7                  Am
The big big bang, the reason i'm alive,
                   E                          Am
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside.
             Dm7    Am    E    Am
The big big bang (3x)

[Verse]
 A                                  Dm7
Take it from me, i don't wanna be, mummified,
Sometimes i feel so isolated,
  G                  A
I wanna die. and now take it from me, if you got it.
 Dm7
Every time, so baby,
                      G
Bring your body here, next to mine.
        E
Next to mine!
              Am
I don't wanna dream!
  Dm7
I just wanna live!
   E                   Am
So baby, not lets miss this thing!

[Chorus]
            Dm7                  Am
The big big bang, the reason i'm alive,
                      E                        Am
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside.
            Dm7     Am    E   Am
The big big bang (3x)
Hite me, big big big bang.
Oh, baby (3x) </pre>
