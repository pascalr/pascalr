Cunningham's Law states "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

The concept is named after Ward Cunningham, father of the wiki. According to Steven McGeady,[1] the law's author, Wikipedia may be the most well-known demonstration of this law.[2]

Cunningham's Law can be considered the Internet equivalent of the French saying "prÃªcher le faux pour savoir le vrai" (preach the falsehood to know the truth). In "Duty Calls," xkcd references a similar concept.[3]
