For texting:

Another example: if someone has a common name, like Stephanie, I may tell them, I already know two Stephanies, so I’m making them Stephanie 3. The next day, I may send her a text that’s either a positive SOI, “You’re officially promoted to Stephanie 2.” Or a teasing disqualifier: “I just met another Stephanie at work, so you are officially Stephanie #4 now. :)”
