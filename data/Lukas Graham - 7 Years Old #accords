[Intro]
Em  G  C  D
Em  G  C
[Chorus 1]
Em                      G
Once I was seven years old,
              C
my momma told me,             
                                           D
go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Em                      G           C
once I was Seven years old
[Verse 1]
Em            D   G
It was a big big world,
                                C
but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits,
         D                  Em
we were learning quicker.
          D      G
By eleven smoking herb
                             C
and drinking burning liquor
                                       D
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
[Chorus 2]
Em                D     G
Once I was eleven years old,
              C
my daddy told me,
                                    D
go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Em                D     G     C     
Once I was eleven years old
[Verse 2]
Em            D    G
I always have that dream
                         C 
like my Daddy before me                    
So I started writing songs
          D                Em 
I started writing stories
                     D  G
Something about that glory,  
                              C
just always seemed to bore me,                  
Cause only those I really love 
          D
will ever really know me
[Chorus 3]
Em                D     G
Once I was twenty years old,
             C
my story got told,
                                      D
before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Em                D     G     C          Em
Once I was twenty years old       
[Verse 3]
           D  G
I only see my goals,
                              C
I don't believe in failure.               
Cause I know the smallest voices,
         D               Em
they can make it major,
              D   G                           C
I got my boys with me at least those in favor                
and if we don´t see before I leave,
          D
I hope to see you later.
[Chorus 4]
Em                D     G
Once I was twenty years old
             C
my story got told                  
I was writing about everything,
        D
I saw before me
Em                D     G       C
Once I was twenty years old
[Chorus 5]
Em               D     G
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
                    C
our songs have been sold
we've traveled around the world
                D
and we´re still roaming
Em               D     G      C     
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
[Verse 5]
Em                            G
I´m still learning about life
                               C
my woman brought children for me
so I can sing them all my songs
          D                 C
and I can tell them stories             
Most of my boys are with me
Cmaj7                              C
some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
           F#/D
my brother I´m still sorry
[Chorus 6]
C                  D     Em
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                   D   
my daddy got sixty-one
                            F#/D
remember life and then your life
                     C
becomes a better one
I made a man so happy
D              Em
when I wrote a letter once
Bm                           
I hope my children come and visit
once or twice a month
[Chorus 7]
C                  D     G    
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                          D
will I think the world is cold
                        F#/D
or will I have a lot of children
who can warm me
C                  D     G       C
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
[Chorus 7]
Em                 D     G    
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                          C
will I think the world is cold
or will I have a lot of children
        D
who can warm me
Em                 D    G       C   
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
