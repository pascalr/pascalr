How do I use my inflatable mattress?

Your inflatable mattress is very comfortable, so you can enjoy a good night's sleep and wake feeling great in the morning. However, it can get damaged if you don't take a few simple precautions before using it. So we advise you to follow a few rules to avoid any problems when you go off camping! Check out all our tips one by one:
 

1/ Test your mattress by inflating it before you set off:

All our mattresses are inflated once at the factory to ensure they work properly. 

However, we recommend you inflate it yourself after purchase, at home before using it. This simple action will check that the product has not been damaged during delivery and works properly. This will help avoid any nasty surprises.

2/ Inflate your mattress to the right pressure:

Ideally, this type of mattress should generally be inflated to a moderate pressure (0.02 BAR or 0.3 PSI) which, when seated on the mattress, means you can feel the ground through your buttocks. Once you lie on it, the mattress then moulds to the shape of your body, offering an optimal level of comfort.

If you prefer to sleep on a firmer mattress, you can inflate it further, but never exceed 0.5 PSI. We recommend using a Quechua 5.2 L type of pump, which is our most effective option.
