[Verse 1]
Dm                 Fmaj7             C                      Dm
We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change.
Dm                Fmaj7                C                   Dm
The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange.
Dm          Fmaj7                 C                        Dm
He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes.
Dm       Fmaj7           C                  Dm
"Get a job you fucking slob," is all he replies.
Dm       Fmaj7               C                  Dm
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes.
Dm                       Fmaj7                C                Dm
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues.

[Verse 2]
Dm          Fmaj7                  C                        Dm
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom, that said he was in love.
Dm        Fmaj7                                         C                        Dm  
He said, "Don't worry about a thing, baby doll, I'm the man you've been dreaming of."
Dm           Fmaj7                  C                        Dm
But 3 months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
Dm              Fmaj7                    C                        Dm
And she swear, "God damn, if I find that man, I'm cuttin' off his balls."
Dm           Fmaj7                                   C                          Dm
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walking through the door.
Dm              Fmaj7                       C                          Dm
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner and they call her a whore.
Dm       Fmaj7               C                  Dm
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes.
Dm                     Fmaj7                  C                Dm

[Bridge](Picked like the intro)
Dm                                             Fmaj7                       C
I've seen a rich man beg. I've seen a good man sin. I've seen a tough man cry.
Dm                                   Fmaj7                        C
I've seen a loser win. And a sad man grin. I heard an honest man lie.
Dm                                                Fmaj7                   C
I've seen the good side of bad. And the downside of up. And everything between.
Dm                                              Fmaj7                          C
I licked the silver spoon. Drank from the golden cup. And smoked the finest green.
Dm                                                Fmaj7                         C
I stroked the fattest dimes, at least a couple of times. Before I broke their heart.
Dm                                  Fmaj7                   C
You know where it ends, it usually depends, on where you start.

I knew this kid named Max, who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs.
Dm                   Fmaj7                       C                             Dm
He liked to hang out late, he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs.
Dm             Fmaj7                     C                        Dm
Until late one night there was a big old fight and Max lost his head.
Dm                Fmaj7                    C                   Dm
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead.
Dm                   Fmaj7                  C                     Dm
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain.
Dm                     Fmaj7                          C                      Dm
You know it comes that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game.
Dm       Fmaj7               C                  Dm
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news.
Dm                     Fmaj7                  C               Dm
