Verse 1 : 



Am 

I won’t try to argue now 

  Em                                Dm 

Anyway I feel there’s nothing I could say 

   F         G 

To ease your mind 

Am 

Maybe there’s nothing exciting outside 

     Em                           Dm 

But ‘round here I’m just wasting my time 

          F                G 

Spinning ‘round on nothing new 

     Am               Em           Dm 

When I close my eyes I remember that kiss 

           F             G 

I’d rather keep them wide open 

     Am                             Dm 

And if I miss that train do you really think 

          Dm          F         G 

That even here, I’d be closer to you 







Chorus :



Am             Em Dm   F       G 

So,  here I am,           leaving soon and

Am     Em    Dm              F     G 

I’m   stan……………ding   at   gate  22 

A 

’Cause whatever you may think I forgot 

G                                  F

You know I’m still thinking about it 

            Dm          G

Sometimes I wish I could stay 

A

But no matter where I go, no matter how long 

G                              F

You know I’ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories

                Dm                 G

I’m leaving but my mind will surely stay 

Am 

At gate 22 





Verse 2 : 



Am

There’s too many dreams I must chase down 

  Em                                 Dm    F   G

Though sometimes I bite off more than I      can chew 

 Am

I know you’d like to keep me near 

  Em                    Dm

I know it’s easier to be two 

                    F         G 

But I can’t plan my life all around you 

  Am                        Em          

I’m weaker than I’ll let you know 

                             Dm

So don’t ask me to jump this wall 

     F                G

From here it looks too tall 

     Am                            Em

Two people kissing goodbye facing a door 

          Dm           F         G

A classic picture we’re all tired of 







Chorus :



Am             Em Dm   F       G 

So,  here I am,           leaving soon and

Am     Em    Dm              F     G 

I’m   stan……………ding     at   gate  22 

A 

’Cause whatever you may think I forgot 

G                                  F

You know I’m still thinking about it 

            Dm          G

Sometimes I wish I could stay 

A

But no matter where I go, no matter how long 

G                              F

You know I’ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories

                Dm                 G

I’m leaving but my mind will surely stay 

Am 

At gate 22 





Verse 3 :



Am                               Em

I already see the picture of that day 

                                     Dm

When you’ll say that you’ll wait for me 

            F         G               Am

And I’ll pretend just then to believe you 

              Em                            Dm

I’ll send you post cards for a few weeks and then 

        F                     G

Another perfect moment at the wrong time 

      Dm           G

But the timing is always wrong 





Chorus :



Am             Em Dm   F       G 

So,  here I am,           leaving soon and

Am     Em    Dm              F     G 

I’m   stan……………ding     at   gate  22 

A 

’Cause whatever you may think I forgot 

G                                  F

You know I’m still thinking about it 

            Dm          G

Sometimes I wish I could stay 

A

But no matter where I go, no matter how long 

G                              F

You know I’ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories

                Dm                 G

I’m leaving but my mind will surely stay 

Am          Em       Dm         F         G

At gate 22
