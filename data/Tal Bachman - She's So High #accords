[Verse]
A            E         D
She's blood, flesh and bone 
A           E     D   
No tucks or silicone 
A              E             D           A
She's touch, smell, sight, taste and sound 
     E                  D    
But somehow I can't believe 
                        A 
That anything should happen 
E                   D  
I know where I belong 
                     A
And nothing's gonna happen 
    E    
Yeah, yeah 
[Chorus]
                  Bm  D
'Cause she's so high... 
        A                E      
High above me, she's so lovely 
           Bm   D     
She's so high... 
         A               E            Bm D  A  E
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite 
          Bm  D    
She's so high... 
         A
High above me 
[Verse]
A            E         D
First class and fancy free 
A           E     D   
She's high society 
A              E             D           A
She's got the best of everything 
     E                  D    
What could a guy like me 
                       A 
Ever really offer? 
E                   D  
She's perfect as she can be 
                     A
Why should I even bother? 
[Chorus]
                  Bm  D
'Cause she's so high... 
        A                E      
High above me, she's so lovely 
           Bm   D     
She's so high... 
         A               E            Bm D  A  E
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite 
          Bm  D    
She's so high... 
         A
High above me 
[Verse]
A            E         D
She comes to speak to me 
A           E     D   
I freeze immediately 
A              E             D           A
'Cause what she says sounds so unreal 
   E                  D    
But somehow I can't believe 
                      A 
That anything should happen 
E                   D  
I know where I belong 
                    A
And nothing's gonna happen 
  E    
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah 
[Chorus]
                  Bm  D
'Cause she's so high... 
        A                E      
High above me, she's so lovely 
           Bm   D     
She's so high... 
         A               E            Bm D  A  E
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite 
          Bm  D    
She's so high... 
         A
High above me </pre>
