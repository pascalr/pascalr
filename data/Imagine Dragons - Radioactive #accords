[Verse 1]
Bm           D             A
  I'm waking up to ash and dust
          E                    Bm
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
              D             A   N.C.
I'm breathing in the chemicals  (Gasp)
Bm             D           A                 E                   Bm
  I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
        D            A
This is it, the apocalypse
  E
Whoa

[Chorus 1]
           Bm            D    
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
 A                E
Enough to make my systems blow
Bm                     D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Bm     D         A            E

  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

Bm           D            A
I raise my flags, don my clothes
          E                    Bm
It's a revolution, I suppose
              D                  A
We're painted red to fit right in
E
Whoa
Bm          D            A                 E
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus

This is it, the apocalypse
E
Whoa

[Chorus 2]
           Bm            D
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
 A                E
Enough to make my systems blow
Bm                     D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
A                      E
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Bm     D         A            E
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Bm     D         A            E
  Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

Deep in my bones, straight from inside
