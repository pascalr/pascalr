[Verse 1]
G
Right from the start
           C                  Em
You were a thief you stole my heart
    C                 G
And I your willing victim
G                                  C                     Em
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         C                      G
And with every touch you fixed them
    Em                  A         D    Dsus4
Now you've been talking in your sleep  oh oh
Em               A      D   Dsus4
Things you never say to me  oh oh
Em                  A    Dsus4
Tell me that you've had enough
G      C     G/B   Dsus4 D
Of our love, our love

[Chorus]
G                            D/F#
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
       Em                            Bm
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           Dsus4
And we can learn to love again
G                            D/F#                        Em
It's in the stars, It's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken just bent
           Dsus4               G
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2]
   G                              C              Em
Im sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
  C                    G
I thought that we were fine

(Oh we had everything)
     G                              C                 Em
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everything
    C               G
And its all in your mind

(Yeah but this is happening)
Em                 A7        D       Dsus4
You've been having real bad dreams  Oh oh
    Em             A7        D   Dsus4
You used to lie so close to me  Oh oh
        Em                A7     D
There's nothing more than empty sheets
  G         C     G/B   Am           C     G/B   Dsus4   D
Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love

[Chorus]
G                            D/F#
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
       Em                            Bm
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           Dsus4
And we can learn to love again
G                             D/F#                         Em
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
                       Bm
You're not broken just bent
           Dsus4                   Em
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge]
Em                 Bm
Oh tears ducts and rust
                C
I'll fix it for us
                 D
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
Em                Bm
You're holding it in, You're pouring a drink
C                Am7      Dsus4  D
No nothing is as bad as it seems
N.C.
We'll come clean

[Chorus]
N.C.
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again.

[Chorus]
G                            D/F#
Just give me a reason just a little bit's enough
       Em                            Bm
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           Dsus4
And we can learn to love again
G                            D/F#                        Em
It's in the stars, It's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken just bent
           Dsus4              G
And we can learn to love again

[Outro]
G  D/F#                    Em
Ohhh we can learn to love again
      Bm       Dsus4              G
Ohhhhh we can learn to love again
D/F#  Em
    ohh
Em                          Bm              Dsus4
That we're not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
