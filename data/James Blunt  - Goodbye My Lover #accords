[Verse 1]
     E                   C#m 
    Did i dissapoint you, or let you down?
     A                                         B 
    Should i be feeling guilty, or let the judges frown?
     E                  C#m 
    'Cos i saw the end, before we'd begun
     G#m                               A            B
    Yes i saw you were blinded, and i knew i had won.
          E                     C#m
    So I took what's mine by eternal right.
     A                               B
    Took your soul out into the night.
     E                     C#m
    It may be over but it won't stop there,
         G#m                    A    B
    I am here for you if you'd only care.    
         E 
    You touched my heart, you touched my soul,
         C#m 
    You changed my life and all my goals,
         A 
    And love is blind and that i knew when,
       A                  B   
    My heart was blinded by you.
     E 
    I've kissed your lips and held your head,
     C#m 
    Shared your dreams and shared your bed,
     G#m 
    I know you well, i know your smell,
     A            B            E 
    I've been, addicted to you.

[Chorus]
     E                C#m 
    Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend,
     A                                B                 E 
    You have been the one, you have been the one for me.
     E                C#m 
    Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend,
     A                                 B                 E 
    You have been the one, you have been the one for me.

[Verse 2]
     E              C#m 
    I am a dreamer, but when i wake,
     A                                  B 
    You can't break my spirit, its my dreams you take,
     E                C#m 
    And as i move on, remember me,
     G#m                   A           B 
    Remember us and all we, used to be.
     E 
    I've seen you cry, i've seen you smile,
     C#m 
    I've watched you sleeping for a while,
     A 
    I'd be the father of your child,
     A                      B
    I'd spend, a lifetime with you.
     E 
    I know your fears and you know mine,
     C#m 
    We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
     G#m 
    And i love you, i swear thats true,
     A        B                    E
    I cannot live, without you.

[Chorus]
     E                C#m 
    Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend,
     A                              B                  E 
    You have been the one, you have been the one for me.
     E                C#m 
    Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend,
     A                               B                  E 
    You have been the one, you have been the one for me.
    E   A   E   B

           A     C#m               G#m      A                   B
    And i still, hold your hand in mine, in mine when i'm asleep
           A    C#m             G#m             A             B
    And i will, bear my soul in time, when i'm kneeling at your feet.
