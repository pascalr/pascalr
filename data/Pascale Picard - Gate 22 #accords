Gate 22                                  (Pascale Picard) 
Couplet: C#m / G#m / F#m / A B /
Refrain: E / B / A / F#m A / B 
Intro: Piano  
C#m 
C#m 
I won’t try to argue now 
  G#m                                 F#m 
Anyway I feel there’s nothing I could say 
   A         B 
To ease your mind 
C#m 
Maybe there’s nothing exciting outside 
     G#m                            F#m 
But ‘round here I’m just wasting my time 
          A                B 
Spinning ‘round on nothing new 
     C#m               G#m           F#m 
When I close my eyes I remember that kiss 
           A              B 
I’d rather keep them wide open 
     C#m                             G#m 
& if I miss that train do you really think 
          F#m          A         B 
That even here, I’d be closer to you 
Refrain 
C#m             G#m F#m   A       B 
So,  here I am,           leaving soon and
C#m       G#m      F#m        A     B 
I’m   stan……………ding     at   gate  22 
E 
’Cause whatever you may think I forgot 
B                                  A
You know I’m still thinking about it 
            F#m          B
Sometimes I wish I could stay 
E
But no matter where I go, no matter how long 
B                              A
You know I’ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
                F#m                 B
I’m leaving but my mind will surely stay 
C#m 
At gate 22 
 C#m 
There’s too many dreams I must chase down 
  G#m                                 F#m    A   B
Though sometimes I bite off more than I      can chew 
 C#m
I know you’d like to keep me near 
  G#m                    F#m
I know it’s easier to be two 
                    A         B 
But I can’t plan my life all around you 
  C#m                        G#m          
I’m weaker than I’ll let you know 
                             F#m
So don’t ask me to jump this wall 
     A                 B
From here it looks too tall 
     C#m                            G#m
Two people kissing goodbye facing a door 
          F#m           A         B
A classic picture we’re all tired of 
Refrain 
C#m             G#m F#m   A       B 
So,  here I am,           leaving soon and
C#m       G#m      F#m        A     B 
I’m   stan……………ding      at   gate  22 
E 
’Cause whatever you may think I forgot 
B                                  A
You know I’m still thinking about it 
            F#m          B
Sometimes I wish I could stay 
E
But no matter where I go, no matter how long 
B                              A
You know I’ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
                F#m                 B
I’m leaving but my mind will surely stay 
C#m 
At gate 22
C#m                               G#m
I already see the picture of that day 
                                     F#m
When you’ll say that you’ll wait for me 
            A         B               C#m
And I’ll pretend just then to believe you 
              G#m                            F#m
I’ll send you post cards for a few weeks and then 
        A                     B
Another perfect moment at the wrong time 
      F#m           B
But the timing is always wrong 
Refrain 
C#m             G#m F#m   A       B 
So,  here I am,           leaving soon and
C#m       G#m      F#m        A     B 
I’m   stan……………ding      at   gate  22 
E 
’Cause whatever you may think I forgot

            F#m          B
Sometimes I wish I could stay 
E
But no matter where I go, no matter how long 
B                              A
You know I’ll keep hanging on. Sweet memories
                F#m                 B
I’m leaving but my mind will surely stay
