Come Sail Away chords
Styx  1977 (The Grand Illusion)
C Dm Em Dm C   G
C   Em       Am  Am \ G \ F
I'm sailing away,
                           G
set an open course for the virgin sea
       C    Em        Am  Am \ G \ F
'Cause I've got to be free,
                              G
free to face the life that's ahead of me
Am                      G
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
Am                       G
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
         C    G             Am  Am \ G \ F
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try,
   G     C
to carry on
C Dm Em Dm C   G 
C Em          Am  Am \ G \ F
I look to the sea,
                                  G
reflections in the waves spark my memory
C    Em          Am  Am \ G \ F
Some happy, some sad,
                                      G
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had
Am                      G
We lived happily forever, so the story goes
Am                       G
But somehow we missed out, on the pot of gold
          C    G            Am  Am \ G \ F
But we'll try, best that we can,
   G     C
to carry on
  C            F
A gathering of angels,
 G                F
appeared above my head
     C               F
They sang to me this song of hope,
    G                 F
and this is what they said, they said
C               F
Come sail away, come sail away,
     C              F
come sail away with me, lads
C               F
Come sail away, come sail away,
     C              F
come sail away with me
C               F
Come sail away, come sail away,
     C              F
come sail away with me, lads
C               F
Come sail away, come sail away,
     C              F
come sail away with me
  C                      F
I thought that they were angels,
    G             F
but much to my surprise;
   C                    F
we climbed aboard their starship,
    G              F
and headed for the skies
C               F
Come sail away, come sail away,
     C              F
come sail away with me, lads
C               F
Come sail away, come sail away,
     C              F  C F G F
come sail away with me  5x
