[Verse]
C         G                   F
Somebody said you got a new friend
C         G                      F
Does she love you better than I can?
[Refrain]
Am      G                 F
yeah, I know it's stupid
F                            C
I just gotta see it for myself
[Chorus]
C          G                    F
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh..
C              G                   F
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh..
Am           G                       F
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooohh..
Am    G             F
I keep dancing on my own
[Verse 2]
C              G              F
I'm just gonna dance all night
C              G                     F
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line
[Refrain]
Am           G             F
Stilettos and broken bottles,
F                             C
I'm spinnin' around in circles
[Chorus]
C          G                    F
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh..
C              G                   F
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh..
Am           G                       F
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooohh..
Am    G             F
I keep dancing on my own

[Bridge]
F       G                  Am              G                  F
so far away but still so near (the lights go on, the music dies)
F              G               Am             G                 C
but you don't see me standing here (I just came to say goodbye)
[Chorus]
                                         C   Am
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh..
Am           G                       F
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooohh..
Am    G             F
I keep dancing on my own
C          G                    F
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh no
C              G                   F
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh no
C           G                       F
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooohh..
C   G             F
I keep dancing on my own

C       G                  F                                 Am
so far away but still so near (the lights go on, the music dies)
Am               G         F
but you don't see me standing here</pre>
