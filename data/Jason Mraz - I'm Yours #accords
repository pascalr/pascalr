<pre>Easier with capo IV

[Intro]
B   F#  G#m  E

[Verse 1]
B
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it,
F#
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
G#m                                    E
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back
B
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
F#
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
G#m                            E
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

[Chorus 1]
B                  F#         G#m
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
          E
It cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 2]
B                                    F#
Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                   G#m
Open up your plans and then you're free
                                     E
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
B                                                    F#
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
                   G#m
We're just one big family
                                       E                      F#7
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

[Chorus 2]
B                F#               G#m
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
             E
It cannot wait, I'm sure

[Bridge]
B                              F#
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
G#m               E
This is our fate, I'm yours
B              F#/A#
D-D-do do you, but do you, D-D-do
G#m
But do you want to come on
F#                    E
Scooch on over closer dear
                      Fdim
And I will nibble your ear

[Verse 3]
B
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
F#
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
G#m
But my breath fogged up the glass
E
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
B
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
F#
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
G#m                     E
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue

[Chorus 1]
  B               F#          G#m
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
                E
It cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 4]
B                               F#
Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                  G#m
Open up your plans and man you're free
                                      E
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
B                          F#
There's no need to complicate
                    G#m
'Cause our time is short
            E
This is our fate
          B
I'm yours</pre>
