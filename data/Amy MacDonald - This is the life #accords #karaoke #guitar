Capo 4th Fret

[Intro]

Am  F  C  Em



[Verse]

Am

Oh, the wind whistles down

F

The cold dark street tonight

          C                             Em

And the people they were dancing to the music vibe

          Am

And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair

F

While the shy tormented youth sit way over there

          C

And the songs they get louder

                       Em

Each one better than before



[Chorus]

                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight



                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight

                         Am

Where you gonna sleep tonight



[Instrumental]

(Am)  F  C  Em



[Verse]

           Am

So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four

            F

And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door

     C                                   Em

But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four

           Am

So you're sitting there with nothing to do

          F

Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew

      C                                                   Em

And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight



[Chorus]

                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight?



                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight?

                         Am

Where you gonna sleep tonight?

                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight?



                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight?



                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight?



                        Am

And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life

                         F

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

                   C

Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

                         Em

Where you gonna sleep tonight?

                         Am

Where you gonna sleep tonight?
