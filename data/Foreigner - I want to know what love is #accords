Intro: Dm, C Dm, Bb Dm,
Verse:
Dm, C Dm                               C Dm
         I've gotta take a little time
          Bb                     Dm(hold until next chord)
A little time to think things over
Dm (strum this on 'I' as a repeat) C Dm
I better read between the lines
           Bb              Dm
In case I need it when I'm older
C      C(hold)
Oooohhhh
Dm                C        F
Now this mountain I must climb
                Bb             Dm
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Dm                    C         F
Through the clouds I see love shine
             Bb                Dm
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
Pre-chorus:
       Gm(x2)             C             Gm
In my life there's been heartache and pain
      Gm(x2)           C        Gm
I don't know if I can face it again
      Gm(x2)           C          Gm
Can't stop now I've travelled so far
     Bb     F  Bb      Gm
To change this lonely life

Dm                          C Dm
I'm gonna take a little time
         Bb             Dm
A little time to look around me
Dm                            C Dm
I've got nowhere left to hide
               Bb                Dm
It looks like love has finally found me
