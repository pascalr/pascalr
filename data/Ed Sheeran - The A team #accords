[Intro]
G   G   G/F# Em  Cadd9  G   
[Verse 1]
G                                 G/F#      Em
White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
         Cadd9        G        A7sus4
Burnt lungs, sour taste
G                                      G/F#   Em
Light’s gone, day’s end, struggling to pay rent
          Cadd9       G
Long nights, strange men
[Pre-Chorus]
Am7                              C*                   G*
And they say she’s in the Class A Team, stuck in her daydream
                    D/F#               Am7                          C*
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
               G*                            D/F#
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream the worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 1]
          Em           Cadd9       G
Cos she's just under the upperhand, and go mad for a couple of grams
Em                    Cadd9    G
And she don’t want to go outside tonight
         Em                    Cadd9      G
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland, or sells love to another man
Em         Cadd9   G       D/F#      Em    Cadd9  G
It’s too cold outside for angels to fly,
              Em   Cadd9  G    G/F#
for angels to fly
[Verse 2]
G                                          G/F#       Em
Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim and stay afloat
      Cadd9          G         A7sus4
Dry house, wet clothes
G                                     G/F#      Em
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
       Cadd9    G
Call girl, no phone
[Pre-Chorus]
Am7                              C*                   G*
And they say she’s in the Class A Team, stuck in her daydream
                    D/F#               Am7                          C*
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
               G*                            D/F#
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream the worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 1]
          Em           Cadd9       G
Cos she's just under the upperhand, and go mad for a couple of grams
Em                    Cadd9    G
And she don’t want to go outside tonight
         Em                    Cadd9      G
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland, or sells love to another man
Em         Cadd9   G       D/F#      Am7
It’s too cold outside for angels to fly
[Bridge]
Am7           C*              Em
An angel will die, covered in white
       G/F#    G
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
Am7                       C*  slide Dadd4            Em   C*   G*  D/F#
This time, we’ll fade out tonight, straight down the line
                    Em   C*  G*  D/F#
Straight down the line
[Pre-Chorus]
Am7                              C*                   G*
And they say she’s in the Class A Team, stuck in her daydream
                    D/F#               Am7                          C*
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
               G*                            D/F#
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream the worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 2]
          Em           Cadd9      G
And we're all under the upperhand, and go mad for a couple of grams
Em                   Cadd9    G
And we don’t want to go outside tonight
         Em                    Cadd9      G
And in a pipe we'll fly to the Motherland, or sell love to another man
Em         Cadd9   G       D/F#      Em    Cadd9  G
It’s too cold outside for angels to fly,
              Em   Cadd9  G   G/F#
for angels to flyyyyy
Em   Cadd9 G            G/F# Em   Cadd9    G
Flyyyy, flyyyyyy, angels to  fly, fly, flyyy
   D/F#      G
Or angels to die
