[Verse]
G               Am     G             D          G
Go 'way from my window leave at your own chosen speed
G                     Am            G       D       G
I'm not the one you want, Babe, I'm not the one you need.
    G                 Am                 G             Am
You say you're looking for someone never weak but always strong
      G              Am               G              Am
To protect you and defend you whether you are right or wrong
    C                          D
Someone to open each and every door
             G
But it ain't me, Babe,
C       D            G
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.

[Verse 2]
G                    Am             G       D      G
Go lightly from the ledge, Babe, go lightly on the ground,
G                   Am                 G     D       G
I'm not the one you want, Babe, I will only let you down.
   G                   Am                    G               Am
You say you're looking for someone who will promise never to part
G                   Am               G                  Am
Someone to close his eyes for you, someone to close his heart
    C                            D
Someone who will die for you and more
             G
But it ain't me, Babe,
C       D            G
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.

[Verse 3]
G                    Am             G       D                 G
Go melt back in the night, Babe, everything inside is made of stone,
G                      Am              G      D    G
There's nothing in here moving and anyway I'm not alone
 G                     Am                          G                 Am
You say you're looking for someone Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
G                   Am               G                  Am
To gather flowers constantly and to come each time you call
 C                              D
A love of your life and nothing more
             G
But it ain't me, Babe,
C       D            G
No, no, no, it ain't me, Babe,
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're looking for, Babe.</pre>
