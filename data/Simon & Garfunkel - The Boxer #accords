B                                                G#m
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
           F#
I have squandered my resistance
      E                               B
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
             G#m           F#                 E
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                    B      F#   E F# B
And disregards the rest
                                                     G#m
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
         F#
In the company of strangers
       E                              B
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
       G#m          F#               E                            B
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
         F#             E   F#    B
Looking for the places only they would know
[Interlude]
        G#m
Lie-la-lie
        F#
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
        G#m
Lie la lie
F#                                 F#  B

[Verse]
                                                 G#m
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
                F#
But I get no offers
         E                               B
Just a come-on from the whores on seventh avenue
        G#m             F#            E                                 B
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there

[Interlude]
        F#              E F# B
Do da do do do do da do
        G#m
Lie-la-lie
        D#m
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
        G#m
Lie la lie
F#                               F#  B

[Verse]
B
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
              G#m
And wishing I was gone
       F#            E                       B
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
            G#m
Leading me
        F#
Going Home
       B                                            G#m
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
          F#
And he carries the reminders
    F#                              B
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him 'till he cried out
                        G#m
In his anger and his shame
        F#             E                              B
"I am Leaving, I am Leaving."  But the Fighter still remains
      F#               E F# B
Do da do do do do da do
